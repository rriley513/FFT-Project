# FFT-Project
Poster &amp; Java code for senior project on the Fast Fourier Transformation

The poster was designed for my college's senior computer science poster project. Corem et al.'s Introduction to Algorithms' chapter on the Fast Fourier Tranform  was used as a research reference, and the code was written with reference to the pseudocode provided in the textbook. The code, written in Java, has static methods for a O(n^2) Discrete Fourier Transformation and a O(nlogn) Fast Fourier Transformation. Both reference Sedgewick's public Complex numbers class, from https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/97data/Complex.java.html although additional methods were added to the class.

Many thanks to Greg Johnson, Senior SWE at Celestial Oncology (at time of project, Principal SWE at NovaSignal) for his mentorship and support in my research.
